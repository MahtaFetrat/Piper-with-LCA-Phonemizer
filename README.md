# Enhanced PiperTTS with Lightweight Context-Aware Phonemization (Piper + LCA)

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Enhanced PiperTTS system** introduced in our paper: *"Beyond Unified Models: A Service-Oriented Approach to Low-Latency, Context-Aware Phonemization for Real-Time TTS"*. The repository is **forked from the original PiperTTS**, preserving its structure, while adding components for **context-aware phonemization** and **task-specific neural improvements**.

The primary goal of this work is to enhance the phonemization quality of lightweight, real-time TTS models while preserving their speed and efficiency, specifically for **Persian text-to-speech applications**.
